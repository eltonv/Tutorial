## Introduction

- I am aiming to create a LCD todolist that will just sit at my desk
What is the motivation behind the tutorial?
- I tend to forget a lot of the things I need to do throughout the day especially if its not in front of me.
What do you want readers to gain from the tutorial?
- Power. Aside from that, i hope readers can learn how to program a LCD display and be become more confident in wiring on a bread board.
### Learning Objectives

- Bullet list of skills/concepts to be covered
- Programming
- prototyping
  
Any additional notes from the developers can be included here.

### Background Information

Describe your topic here. What does it do? Why do you use it?
Are there other similar things to use? What are the pros and cons?
Explain important concepts that are necessary to understand.
Include (and cite if needed) any visuals that will help the audience understand.
Its just going to be a todo list that is displaying tasks i need to complete for the day. There are other things similar to use but this could be made with common parts .

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.



### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.



Arduino IDE
(some driver i cant remember of the top of my head)
